        <div>
            <p>This project is intended to simulate the use of a blockchain in a farm environment that uses IoT devices, towards the particular goal of tracking chemical usage on crops. This would help to alleviate food supply chain concerns from the ground level: every detected chemical use would be logged and easily visible.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Located in on this site are a page for manual addition and a page for automated addition. Both pages display the blockchain history -- that is, any chemicals that have been used so far.</p>
